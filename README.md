# github-actions-terraform-example

A repo to demonstrate an implementation of GitHub Actions with Terraform, including GitHub Projects and Issues.

# Example GitHub Actions pipeline with Terraform

This lab is intended as a basic example to get started with using the GitHub Actions, Issues and Projects functionality with Terraform infrastructure as code.

During this lab, we will create:
- A branching strategy to test and deploy to Azure environments.
- A pipeline to deploy to a dev/pre-prod environment.
- A pipeline to deploy to a production environment from a production branch.
- A projects board to capture Issues and to associate pull requests.
